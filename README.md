# Rust And Wasm Tutorials

These video-based(youtube) tutorials attempt to choose something somewhat challenging but at the same time go at a slow pace and try to go over basics.  
<br/>
The approach is to:
- constantly ask "what, why, how"
- try the most minimalist code unless it doesn't make sense to
- use the "onion" - sometimes we go deep into one topic, and at other times it's very shallow but we cover various topics

## Series I - WASM Tutorial (Hands-On Introduction)
  

[WASM Programming Part 1 Install Runtimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FVWZPffZRg)  
In this video we install tree WASM Runtimes (Wasmedge, Wasmtime, and Wasmer)  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/learning-rust-n-wasm-tutorials-playlist-1-part-1) is the code and helpful stuff for Part 1.  
<br/>
  

[WASM Programming Part 2 Hello World]()  
In this video we run a very basic Rust WASM bin and lib against Wasmedge, Wasmtime, and Wasmer.  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/learning-rust-n-wasm-tutorials-playlist-1-part-2) is the code and helpful stuff for Part 2.
