# Rust And Wasm Tutorials

These video-based(youtube) tutorials attempt to choose something somewhat challenging but at the same time go at a slow pace and try to go over basics.  
<br/>
The approach is to:
- constantly ask "what, why, how"
- try the most minimalist code unless it doesn't make sense to
- use the "onion" - sometimes we go deep into one topic, and at other times it's very shallow but we cover various topics

## Series I - WASM Tutorial (Hands-On Introduction)
  

[WASM Programming Part 1 Install Runtimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FVWZPffZRg)  
In this video we install tree WASM Runtimes (Wasmedge, Wasmtime, and Wasmer)  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/learning-rust-n-wasm-tutorials-playlist-1-part-1) is the code and helpful stuff for Part 1.  
<br/>
  

[WASM Programming Part 2 Hello World(and more) With Wasmedge, Wasmtime, and Wasmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONXJs64GN_g)  
In this video we run a very basic Rust WASM bin and lib against Wasmedge, Wasmtime, Wasmer, and Node.js.  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/learning-rust-n-wasm-tutorials-playlist-1-part-2) is the code and helpful stuff for Part 2.  
<br/>
  

[WASM Programming Part 3 Hello World(and more) With Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd69JM3esG4&list=PLNKa8O7lX-w6yajcnJXVkUTgIqyCjWdNf&index=3)  
In this video we sort of mimick the WASM runtimes that we did in Part 2, by writing our own with Javascript.  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/learning-rust-n-wasm-tutorials-playlist-1-part-3) is the code and helpful stuff for Part 3.  
<br/>
  
[WASI Programming Part 4 Hello World(and more) With Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mw5L8HrHGTw)  
In this video we continue with our Node.js Javascript runner from Part 3, but this time we run **WASI**, not just WASM.  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/learning-rust-n-wasm-tutorials-playlist-1-part-4) is the code and helpful stuff for Part 4.  
<br/>
  
[WASM Programming Part 5 By Hand (Text Format, S-Expressions, Stack Machine)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TOy94rKa9M)  
In this video we will write our own WASM code without the help of Rust.  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/learning-rust-n-wasm-tutorials-playlist-1-part-5) is the code and helpful stuff for Part 5.  
<br/>
  
[WASM Programming Part 6 By Hand (Setup - How To Debug)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlijBj3J1mk)  
In this video we write a simple WASM function, a simple HTML file with simple embedded Javascript, to load, compile, instantiate, run, and debug our WASM executable in a browser.  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/learning-rust-n-wasm-tutorials-playlist-1-part-6) is the code and helpful stuff for Part 6.  
<br/>
  
[WASM Programming Part 7 By Hand - Gain Some Insight Into WASM By Debugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YD0Pr8frik)  
In this video we continue where we left off in previous (above) video and play around with some WASM statements and see what the debugging shows us.  
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/learning-rust-n-wasm-tutorials-playlist-1-part-7) is the code and helpful stuff for Part 7.  
<br/>
  
## Series II - RUST, WASM (An RPN Stack VM?)
  
[Rust(WASM?) RPN Calculator Part 1: Analysis & Design Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vMnEs6LrcE)  
In this video we attempt to simulate an RPN Stack Machine (Sort of).
We take a look at Vector as a Stack.
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/learning-rust-n-wasm-tutorials-rpn-calc-playlist-2-part-1) is the code and helpful stuff for Part 1.  
<br/>
  

[Rust(WASM?) RPN Calculator Part 2: Impl Basic Calculator]()  
In this video we implement the basics of an RPN Calculator, using fake inputs, not from the keyboard. Keyboard entry will be in the next video after this one.
[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/learning-rust-n-wasm-tutorials-rpn-calc-playlist-2-part-2) is the code and helpful stuff for Part 2.
