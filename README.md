[Series I WASM Tutorial]()  
<br/>  
<br/>  
These video-based(youtube) tutorials attempt to choose something somewhat challenging but at the same time go at a slow pace and try to go over basics.  
<br/>
The approach is to:
- constantly ask "what, why, how"
- try the most minimalist code unless it doesn't make sense to
- use the "onion" - sometimes we go deep into one topic, and at other times it's very shallow but we cover various topics
